# HelloDesignSystem
This is a simple **Hello World** project which forks and includes the designsystem portion from the [Now In Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) project. 
- Anyone wanting to kickstart a new Jetpack Compose project can use this as a template to directly use the theme system (or extend it). 
- This can also be used as a theme template (reusing the structure) and completely redesign the actual theme itself.
